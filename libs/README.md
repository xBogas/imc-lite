# Embedded Libraries

This folder contains libraries necessary for networking applications on the STM32F7 microcontroller platform, used by this project.

## Contents

- **lwIP (Lightweight IP)**: This library is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite. It is designed for embedded systems and supports various protocols such as IPv4, IPv6, UDP, TCP, ICMP, DHCP, and DNS. The lwIP library provides a low-level API for network communication, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.

  - **Port for RTOS**: The lwIP library has been ported to the STM32F7 platform, specifically targeting the custom Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) used in this project.

- **LAN8742 Ethernet Library**: This library provides support for the LAN8742A/LAN8742Ai Ethernet PHY (Physical Layer) IC on the STM32 platform.
